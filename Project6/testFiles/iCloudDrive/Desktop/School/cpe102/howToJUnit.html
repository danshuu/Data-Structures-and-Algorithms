<div class="header"> <h1>How To Test With JUnit</h1></div>

<p>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JUnit">JUnit</a> is a widely used
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing">unit testing</a>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_framework">framework</a>
for the Java programming language.  It is a member of the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XUnit">xUnit</a> family of frameworks
that support a wide variety of programming languages and is commonly used when
practising
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">TDD</a>
(test-driven development).
</p>

<p>
Take a moment, if necessary, to familiarise yourself with the various terms and
concepts in the previous paragraph.
</p>

<div class="header"> <h3>Environment</h3></div>
<p>
Because JUnit is not part of the Java Standard Library, you will need access to
its source to be able to use it.  I have placed a public copy of
<code>junit-4.12.jar</code> and <code>hamcrest-core-1.3.jar</code> in my
account which you may use (when logged into the Computer Science servers or
workstations).  The examples below will give you the details necessary to do
so.  If you would like to use JUnit on your own machine, you can download the
necessary files from the <a href="http://www.junit.org/">junit.org</a> web
site.
</p>

<div class="header"> <h2>A TDD Example</h2></div>

<p>
Imagine you were going to write a simple class, <code>OddEven</code>, with
methods to tell you if a value is odd or even.  The class will have a single
constructor accepting an integer value and two boolean methods,
<code>odd</code> and <code>even</code> that return <code>true</code> or
<code>false</code> as appropriate.  Following TDD, you would want to:
</p>
<ol>
   <li>
      Develop some test cases for a small part of your code.
   </li>
   <li>
      Write the test cases.
   </li>
   <li>
      Write the code to be tested.
   </li>
   <li>
      Run the tests.
      <ul>
         <li>
            Fail?  Go back to step 3.
         </li>
         <li>
            Pass?  Continue at step 1 with the next part of your code.
         </li>
      </ul>
   </li>
</ol>

<p>
For this class, I think a minimum of five values should be tested, two positive
integers, one even and one odd, two negative integers, one even and one odd,
and zero.  Here is a table of the test cases:
</p>

<center>
   <table>
      <tr class="underline">
         <th class="rbuff">Constructor Input</th>
         <th class="rbuff"> Expected Result for <code>even()</code></th>
         <th>Expected Result for <code>odd()</code></th>
      </tr>
      <tr> <td>86</td> <td><code>true</code></td>
         <td><code>false</code></td></tr>
      <tr> <td>125</td> <td><code>false</code></td>
         <td><code>true</code></td></tr>
      <tr> <td>-62</td> <td><code>true</code></td>
         <td><code>false</code></td></tr>
      <tr> <td>-3</td> <td><code>false</code></td>
         <td><code>true</code></td></tr>
      <tr> <td>0</td> <td><code>true</code></td>
         <td><code>false</code></td></tr>
   </table>
</center>

<p>
Now we write the test cases in Java using JUnit: 
<a href="junit/OddEvenTests.java"><code>OddEvenTests</code></a>.  Be sure to
read all of the comments as they explain much of the syntax for using JUnit.
</p>

<p>
Next up, we write our <a href="junit/OddEven.java"><code>OddEven</code></a>
class.  Note that there is a bug in the solution; <strong><em>don't fix it
      until after you see how JUnit reports the failed tests</em></strong>.
</p>

<div class="header"><h3>Compiling and Running the Tests</h3></div>

<p>
To compile and run the tests with JUnit, you must specify where to find the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JAR_(file_format)">JAR</a> files
containing the JUnit classes.  This is done by modifying the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classpath_(Java)">classpath</a> which
may be done in two ways.  The first way is to specify the path by using the
<code>-cp</code> flag as follows (<strong><em>be sure to include the colon and
      period at the end of the <code>-cp</code> path when
      running</em></strong>):
</p>

<code>
   $ javac -cp /home/btjones/Public/junit/junit-4.12.jar OddEven.java
   OddEvenTests.java<br>
   $ java -cp /home/btjones/Public/junit/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:/home/btjones/Public/junit/junit-4.12.jar:.  org.junit.runner.JUnitCore OddEvenTests<br>
</code>

<p>
This is rather tedious to type out every time we want to use JUnit.  The second
way is to set the <code>CLASSPATH</code> environment variable.  When you do
this, you do not need to include the <code>-cp</code> flag as shown above.
Setting the <code>CLASSPATH</code> environment variable varies by operating
system.  In Linux, you would do the following:
</p>

<code>
   $ export CLASSPATH="${CLASSPATH:+"$CLASSPATH:"}/home/btjones/Public/junit/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar:/home/btjones/Public/junit/junit-4.12.jar:."<br>
</code>

<p>
<strong><em>Be sure to include the colon and period at the end of the
      path!</em></strong> Note that you would have to do this once every time
you log on.  To automate the process, you can add the line above to your
<code>.mybashrc</code>.  See me in lab if you would like help with this.
</p>

<div class="header"><h3>Reading the Output</h3></div>

<p>
Assuming you didn't fix the bug in <code>OddEven</code>, when you finally run
the tests, you probably saw something that looked like:
</p>

<pre>

   ...
   There were 2 failures:
   1) testOdd_negativeOdd(OddEvenTests)
   java.lang.AssertionError
           at org.junit.Assert.fail(Assert.java:86)
           at org.junit.Assert.assertTrue(Assert.java:41)
           at org.junit.Assert.assertTrue(Assert.java:52)
           at OddEvenTests.oddTestNegative2(OddEvenTests.java:55)
           at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method)
   ...
   2) testEven_negativeOdd(OddEvenTests)
   java.lang.AssertionError
           at org.junit.Assert.fail(Assert.java:86)
           at org.junit.Assert.assertTrue(Assert.java:41)
           at org.junit.Assert.assertFalse(Assert.java:64)
           at org.junit.Assert.assertFalse(Assert.java:74)
           at OddEvenTests.evenTestNegative2(OddEvenTests.java:75)
           at sun.reflect.NativeMethodAccessorImpl.invoke0(Native Method)
   ...
   FAILURES!!!
   Tests run: 10,  Failures: 2<br>
</pre>

<p>
The information that spews forth is the stack trace.  It is a list of all the
methods that have been called leading up the error.  All we really need to get
out of all this is that two tests of the ten failed,
<code>oddTestNegative2</code> and <code>evenTestNegative2</code>.  See if you
can reason out why, fix the bug, rerun the tests, and get the output to look
like:
</p>

<pre>

   JUnit version 4.12
   ..........
   Time: 0.007

   OK (10 tests)<br>
</pre>

<div class="header"><h3>Running Multiple Test Classes</h3></div>

<p>
You can compile and run multiple JUnit test classes at the same time (for
programs comprised of more than one class).  To do so, you simply include the
names of all the test classes on the command line as follows:
</p>

<code>
   $ java org.junit.runner.JUnitCore &lt;Class1&gt; &lt;Class2&gt; ...<br>
</code><br>

<div class="header"><h3>Testing for Expected Exceptions</h3></div>

<p>
It is important to test methods that throw exceptions to make sure they
actually throw them as expected.  The JUnit <code>@Test</code> annotation has
an optional form that allows you to specify an expected exception.  When the
test if run, JUnit reports success if the expected exception is thrown and a
failure otherwise.  Don't forget to import the exception class as necessary.
Here is a sample test method for a method that should throw an
<code>IllegalArgumentException</code> when passed a negative number:
</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-java">

   @Test(expected=IllegalArgumentException.class)
   public void someTest() {
      // Test setup...
      SomeClass sc = new SomeClass();

      // The test, call the method in a way that should result in the expected
      // exception
      sc.someMethod(-8);
   }

</pre>

<div class="header"><h3>JUnit Quirks</h3></div>

<ul>
   <li>
      JUnit tests will &ldquo;short-circuit&rdquo;.  This means that a test
      method stops running when it encounters the first error.  As such, you
      should test for different errors in separate test methods.
   </li>
   <li>
      You cannot count of JUnit tests running in any particular order.  This
      means you must not rely on anything between tests.  There are additional
      annotations (<code>@Before</code>, <code>@After</code>,
      <code>@BeforeClass</code>, <code>@AfterClass</code>) that give you some
      order control within an individual test class.
   </li>
</ul>

<p>
To learn more about JUnit&mdash;it has much more functionality than is explored
here&mdash;you are strongly encouraged to explore the
<a href="http://junit.org/javadoc/latest/index.html">JUnit
   documentation</a>, especially that of the <code>Assert</code> class to see
the many useful testing methods.  More information is also available at
<a href="http://www.junit.org/">junit.org</a>.
